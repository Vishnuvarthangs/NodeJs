what is jwt decode();

In the context of JWTs, jwt.decode() is a method commonly used to parse and extract the payload data from a JSON Web
Token. It doesn't verify the token's signature, making it suitable for client-side decoding or initial inspection of
token contents.

Here's how it works:

Accepts a JWT string: You provide the encoded JWT string as the first argument to the jwt.decode() function.
Decodes the Base64-encoded payload: It separates the header, payload, and signature parts of the token and decodes the
Base64-encoded payload portion.
Returns the payload as a JavaScript object: The function parses the decoded payload into a JavaScript object, containing
the claims stored within the token.
Important Considerations:

Client-Side Use: While jwt.decode() is helpful for client-side inspection or debugging, it's crucial to not rely on it
for security-critical actions. Always verify the token's signature on the server-side for authentication and
authorization purposes.
Signature Verification: Use the jwt.verify() method on the server-side to both decode the payload and verify its
authenticity using a secret key. This ensures the token hasn't been tampered with or forged.
Library-Specific: The exact implementation of jwt.decode() might vary slightly depending on the JWT library you're
using. Refer to the documentation for your specific library for details.
Example (using the jsonwebtoken library):

JavaScript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token =
'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c';

try {
const decoded = jwt.decode(token);
console.log(decoded); // Output: { userId: 12345, username: 'John Doe', email: 'johndoe@example.com' }
} catch (error) {
console.error('Error decoding JWT:', error);
}

Remember:

Use jwt.decode() responsibly for non-sensitive operations or initial token inspection.
Always verify the token's signature on the server-side for secure authentication and authorization.
Consult the documentation of your specific JWT library for accurate usage guidelines.
