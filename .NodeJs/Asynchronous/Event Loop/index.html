what is Event Loop in Asynchronous Node.js with example

Here's a comprehensive explanation of the Event Loop in asynchronous Node.js, including examples and images:

Understanding the Event Loop:

The heart of Node.js's non-blocking architecture.
Continuously monitors events (I/O completion, timers, user interactions) and executes corresponding callbacks.
Allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking the main thread.
Process Flow:

JavaScript Code Execution:

Node.js starts executing JavaScript code on the main thread.
When it encounters an asynchronous operation (like reading a file), it delegates the task to the system kernel and moves
on to other code.
The kernel handles the operation in the background and signals Node.js when it's complete.

Event Queues:

Completed asynchronous operations are added to different event queues based on their types (timers, I/O, close
callbacks, etc.).
Event Loop Phases:

The event loop continuously iterates through the following phases:
timers: Executes scheduled timer callbacks.
pending callbacks: Executes pending callbacks from I/O operations and other events.
idle, prepare: Internal bookkeeping tasks.
poll: Checks for new I/O events and executes corresponding callbacks.
check: Executes setImmediate() callbacks.
close callbacks: Executes close events for closed connections.
Callback Execution:

When a phase's queue has pending callbacks, the event loop dequeues them and executes them on the main thread.
Only one callback runs at a time, ensuring single-threaded execution.
Example:

JavaScript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('data.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
console.log(data); // Callback executed when file reading completes
});

console.log('This will be printed first.'); // Main thread continues execution

Key Points:

Single-Threaded but Highly Concurrent: Node.js executes JavaScript code on a single thread, but the event loop enables
efficient handling of multiple concurrent operations.
Non-Blocking I/O: Asynchronous operations don't block the main thread, ensuring responsiveness.
Callback-Driven: Asynchronous results are handled through callbacks, promises, or async/await.
Phase-Based Execution: The event loop prioritizes different events based on their phases.
