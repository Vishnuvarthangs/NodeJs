List of basic asynchronous function in Node.js with example

Here's a list of basic asynchronous functions in Node.js, along with examples:

File System (fs Module):

fs.readFile(filename, [options], callback): Reads the contents of a file asynchronously.
JavaScript
fs.readFile('data.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
if (err) {
console.error(err);
} else {
console.log(data);
}
});
Use code with caution. Learn more
fs.writeFile(filename, data, [options], callback): Writes data to a file asynchronously.
fs.open(path, flags, [mode], callback): Opens a file asynchronously.
fs.stat(path, callback): Gets the status of a file or directory asynchronously.
fs.readdir(path, callback): Reads the contents of a directory asynchronously.
Timers:

setTimeout(callback, delay, [arg]): Schedules a function to be executed after a specified delay in milliseconds.
JavaScript
setTimeout(() => {
console.log('This will be printed after 2 seconds.');
}, 2000);
Use code with caution. Learn more
setInterval(callback, delay, [arg]): Schedules a function to be executed repeatedly at specified intervals.
HTTP:

http.get(options, callback): Makes an HTTP GET request asynchronously.
JavaScript
http.get('https://www.example.com', (res) => {
console.log(`Status: ${res.statusCode}`);
res.on('data', (chunk) => {
console.log(chunk.toString());
});
});
Use code with caution. Learn more
http.createServer([options], callback): Creates an HTTP server instance.
Other Modules:

crypto.randomBytes(size, callback): Generates cryptographically strong pseudorandom bytes asynchronously.
zlib.deflate(buffer, callback): Compresses a buffer asynchronously.
child_process.exec(command, [options], callback): Executes a shell command asynchronously.
Remember:

Node.js offers many more asynchronous functions across various built-in modules and third-party libraries.
Callbacks are a fundamental way to handle results and errors in asynchronous operations.
Promises and async/await provide alternative ways to manage asynchronous code more elegantly.
