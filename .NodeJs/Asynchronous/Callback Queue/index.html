what is Callback Queue in Asynchronous Node.js with example

Here's an explanation of the Callback Queue in asynchronous Node.js, incorporating examples and visual aids:

Understanding the Callback Queue:

Temporary Holding Area: It's a queue where callback functions are stored after asynchronous operations complete, waiting
for their turn to execute.
Part of the Event Loop: The event loop continuously monitors the callback queue and executes callbacks from it when the
main thread is idle.
Ensures Non-Blocking Behavior: Callbacks don't directly go on the call stack, preventing blocking.
How It Works:

Initiating Asynchronous Operation: You initiate an asynchronous operation (like reading a file, fetching data from a
server, or setting a timer).
Callback Registration: You provide a callback function to be executed when the operation completes.
Asynchronous Execution: The operation is performed in the background, typically by the operating system or external
libraries.
Operation Completion: Once the operation finishes, the callback function is added to the callback queue.
Event Loop's Role: The event loop continuously checks the callback queue.
Idle Main Thread: When the main thread is free from executing synchronous code, the event loop picks a callback from the
queue.
Callback Execution: The callback is executed on the main thread, handling the asynchronous operation's result or error.
Example:

JavaScript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('data.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
// Callback added to the queue when file reading completes
console.log(data); // Executed when the event loop picks it
});

console.log('This will be printed first.'); // Main thread continues

Key Points:

Not a Traditional Call Stack: Callbacks in the queue don't follow a LIFO pattern like the call stack. The event loop
determines their execution order based on phases and priorities.
Multiple Callback Queues: Callbacks are categorized into different queues based on their types (timers, I/O, close
callbacks, etc.).
Fundamental to Node.js's Asynchronous Nature: The callback queue enables Node.js to handle multiple concurrent
operations without blocking the main thread, ensuring responsiveness and efficiency.
