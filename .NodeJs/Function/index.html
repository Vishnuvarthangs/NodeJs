what is function in node.js
In Node.js, functions are fundamental building blocks that encapsulate reusable code, organize logic, and promote
modularity within your applications. They are essentially blocks of code that can be executed multiple times with
varying inputs, producing potentially different outputs.

Here are key concepts related to functions in Node.js:

1. Function Declaration:

Defines a function with a name and a body of code.
Example:
JavaScript
function greet(name) {
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

2. Function Expression:

Creates a function and assigns it to a variable.
Example:
JavaScript
const add = function(x, y) {
return x + y;
};
Use code with caution. Learn more
3. Parameters:

Values passed to a function when it's called.
Example: name in greet(name)
4. Return Values:

Values returned by a function using the return keyword.
Example: x + y in add(x, y)
5. Scope:

Variables declared within a function are local to that function, not accessible outside.
Global variables are accessible throughout the application.
6. Callback Functions:

Functions passed as arguments to other functions, often used for asynchronous operations.
Example: fs.readFile('data.txt', (err, data) => { ... });
7. Async/Await:

Syntactic sugar for handling promises, making asynchronous code look more synchronous.
Example:
JavaScript
async function fetchData() {
try {
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
const data = await response.json();
// Process the data
} catch (error) {
console.error(error);
}
}

Benefits of Using Functions:

Reusability: Write code once and use it multiple times in different parts of your application.
Modularity: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions.
Abstraction: Hide implementation details and make code more readable.
Testability: Write unit tests to test individual functions independently.
Remember:

Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and
returned from other functions.
Use functions effectively to create well-structured, maintainable, and testable Node.js applications.
