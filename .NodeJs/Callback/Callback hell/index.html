what is callback hell in node js?
Callback hell is a term used in Node.js development to describe the situation where code becomes excessively nested with
callbacks, making it difficult to read, maintain, and debug. It often occurs when you have multiple asynchronous
operations that depend on each other and you try to manage their coordination using only callbacks.

Here's how it typically unfolds:

Nested Callbacks: You start with a callback within a callback, often due to chaining asynchronous operations.
Pyramid Structure: As more dependent asynchronous calls are added, the code starts to resemble a pyramid of indentation,
hence the nickname "pyramid of doom."
Readability Issues: The nested structure makes it challenging to follow the flow of logic and understand which code
blocks belong to which callbacks.
Error Handling Complexity: Handling errors within nested callbacks can become cumbersome and error-prone.
Maintenance Nightmare: Refactoring code with callback hell can be difficult and time-consuming.
Example:

JavaScript
function doSomethingAsync1(callback1) {
// ... (asynchronous operation)
callback1(result1);
}

function doSomethingAsync2(value1, callback2) {
// ... (asynchronous operation using value1)
callback2(result2);
}

function doSomethingAsync3(value2, callback3) {
// ... (asynchronous operation using value2)
callback3(finalResult);
}

doSomethingAsync1((result1) => {
doSomethingAsync2(result1, (result2) => {
doSomethingAsync3(result2, (finalResult) => {
// ... (final processing with finalResult)
});
});
});

Solutions to Avoid Callback Hell:

Promises: Wrap asynchronous actions in promises, providing a cleaner syntax for chaining and error handling.
async/await: Use the async and await keywords to make asynchronous code look more like synchronous code, improving
readability.
Control Flow Libraries: Consider libraries like async or streamline for advanced control flow management.
Modularization: Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable functions to reduce nesting.
By adopting these approaches, you can write more maintainable, scalable, and enjoyable Node.js applications that avoid
the pitfalls of callback hell.
