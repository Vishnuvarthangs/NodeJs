what is callback chaining in node.js
Callback chaining is a technique used in Node.js to execute multiple asynchronous operations one after the other in a
specific order, where the output of one operation becomes the input for the next. It leverages the nested nature of
callbacks to create a seamless pipeline of tasks.

Here's how it works:

Defining Chained Functions: You define several functions, each performing an asynchronous operation and accepting a
callback argument.

Passing the Data: Within each function, instead of directly processing the results, you pass them as arguments to the
callback function.

Chain Completion: Each callback function then becomes the "next step" in the chain. It receives the data from the
previous step and either processes it directly or passes it on to the next callback in the chain.

Final Callback: The final callback in the chain typically handles the final output of the entire process.

Benefits of Chaining:

Improved readability: Easier to understand the flow of logic compared to nested callbacks.
Modular code: Each function performs a specific task, making the code more maintainable and reusable.
Error handling: Easier to capture and handle errors at each step of the chain.
Example: Imagine downloading an image, resizing it, and then writing it to a new location:

JavaScript
function downloadImage(url, callback) {
// ... perform download and call callback with retrieved data
}

function resizeImage(data, callback) {
// ... resize the image and call callback with resized data
}

function writeImage(data, filename, callback) {
// ... write the resized data to a file and call callback
}

// Chaining the operations
downloadImage('https://example.com/image.jpg', (imageData) => {
resizeImage(imageData, (resizedData) => {
writeImage(resizedData, 'resized_image.jpg', (err) => {
if (err) {
console.error(err);
} else {
console.log('Image downloaded, resized, and saved successfully!');
}
});
});
});

Remember:

Ensure proper error handling at each step to prevent chain failures.
Avoid excessive nesting to maintain code clarity and avoid "callback hell."
