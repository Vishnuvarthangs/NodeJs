Chaining in Node.js can be achieved using the async npm module. In order to install the async module, we need to run the
following script in our directory:

npm init
npm i async
There are two most commonly used methods for chaining functions provided by the async module:

series(tasks, callback): Each function in tasks run only after the previous function is completed. If any of the
functions throw an error, the subsequent functions are not executed and the callback is fired with an error value. On
completion of tasks, the data is passed into the callback function as an array.

Example 2: Series Chaining
Filename: index.js

const async = require('async');

async.series([
(callback) => {
setTimeout(() => {
console.log('This is the first function');
callback(null, 1);
}, 500);
},
(callback) => {
console.log('This is the second function');
callback(null, 2);
}
], (err, results) => {
if (err) console.error(err);
console.log(results);
});
Run index.js file using the following command:

node index.js
Output:

This is the first function
This is the second function
[ 1, 2 ]

Explanation: Unlike the parallel execution, in this case, the second function wasnâ€™t executed until the first function
completed its own execution. Similar to the parallel method, the results are only passed to the callback function once
all the functions in the tasks collection finish execution.
