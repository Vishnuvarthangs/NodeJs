Chaining in Node.js can be achieved using the async npm module. In order to install the async module, we need to run the
following script in our directory:

npm init
npm i async
There are two most commonly used methods for chaining functions provided by the async module:

parallel(tasks, callback): The tasks is a collection of functions that runs parallel in practice through I/O switching.
If any function in the collection tasks returns an error, the callback function is fired. Once all the functions are
completed, the data is passed to the callback function as an array. The callback function is optional.

Example 1: Parallel Chaining
Filename: index.js

const async = require('async');

async.parallel([
(callback) => {
setTimeout(() => {
console.log('This is the first function');
callback(null, 1);
}, 500);
},
(callback) => {
console.log('This is the second function');
callback(null, 2);
}
], (err, results) => {
if (err) console.error(err);
console.log(results);
});
Run index.js file using the following command:


node index.js
Output:

This is the second function
This is the first function
[ 1, 2 ]

Explanation: It is noted that the two functions were executed asynchronously. Hence the output from the second function
was received before the first function finished executing due to the setTimeout() method. However, the data is only
passed to the callback once both the functions finish execution.
