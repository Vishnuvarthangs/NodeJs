This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with “Hello World!” for requests to
the root URL (/) or route. For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found.

The example above is actually a working server: Go ahead and click on the URL shown. You’ll get a response, with
real-time logs on the page, and any changes you make will be reflected in real time. This is powered by RunKit, which
provides an interactive JavaScript playground connected to a complete Node environment that runs in your web browser.
Below are instructions for running the same app on your local machine.

RunKit is a third-party service not affiliated with the Express project.

Running Locally
First create a directory named myapp, change to it and run npm init. Then install express as a dependency, as per the
installation guide.

In the myapp directory, create a file named app.js and copy in the code from the example above.

The req (request) and res (response) are the exact same objects that Node provides, so you can invoke req.pipe(),
req.on('data', callback), and anything else you would do without Express involved.

Run the app with the following command:

$ node app.js

Express app.get() Request Function

The `app.get()` function in Node is designed to route HTTP GET requests to the specified path, associating them with
designated callback functions. Its primary purpose is to link middleware to your application, facilitating the handling
of GET requests at the specified route.

Syntax:

app.get( path, callback )
Parameters:

path: It is the path for which the middleware function is being called.
callback: They can be a middleware function or a series/array of middleware functions.

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI
(or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure:

app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
Where:

app is an instance of express.
METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
PATH is a path on the server.
HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.
This tutorial assumes that an instance of express named app is created and the server is running. If you are not
familiar with creating an app and starting it, see the Hello world example.

The following examples illustrate defining simple routes.

Respond with Hello World! on the homepage:

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Hello World!')
})
Respond to POST request on the root route (/), the application’s home page:

app.post('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Got a POST request')
})
Respond to a PUT request to the /user route:

app.put('/user', (req, res) => {
res.send('Got a PUT request at /user')
})
Respond to a DELETE request to the /user route:

app.delete('/user', (req, res) => {
res.send('Got a DELETE request at /user')
})

GET
The GET method requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state. GET requests should only
retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)[1] For retrieving
resources without making changes, GET is preferred over POST, as they can be addressed through a URL. This enables
bookmarking and sharing and makes GET responses eligible for caching, which can save bandwidth. The W3C has published
guidance principles on this distinction, saying, "Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but
also by the relevant limitations."[53] See safe methods below.

HEAD
The HEAD method requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state, as for a GET request, but
without the representation data enclosed in the response body. This is useful for retrieving the representation metadata
in the response header, without having to transfer the entire representation. Uses include checking whether a page is
available through the status code and quickly finding the size of a file (Content-Length).

POST
The POST method requests that the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request according to the
semantics of the target resource. For example, it is used for posting a message to an Internet forum, subscribing to a
mailing list, or completing an online shopping transaction.[54]

PUT
The PUT method requests that the target resource create or update its state with the state defined by the representation
enclosed in the request. A distinction from POST is that the client specifies the target location on the server.[55]

DELETE
The DELETE method requests that the target resource delete its state.

CONNECT
The CONNECT method requests that the intermediary establish a TCP/IP tunnel to the origin server identified by the
request target. It is often used to secure connections through one or more HTTP proxies with TLS.[56][57] See HTTP
CONNECT method.

OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method requests that the target resource transfer the HTTP methods that it supports. This can be used to
check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.

TRACE
The TRACE method requests that the target resource transfer the received request in the response body. That way a client
can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediaries.

PATCH
The PATCH method requests that the target resource modify its state according to the partial update defined in the
representation enclosed in the request. This can save bandwidth by updating a part of a file or document without having
to transfer it entirely.[58]
All general-purpose web servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods, and all other methods are
considered optional by the specification.[51]
